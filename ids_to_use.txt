1. It is known that lymphocytopenia, defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) < 1000 cells/µL, occurs in Covid‐19 and may correlate with increased disease severity1-5; indeed, lymphocytopenia is a common systemic manifestation of many viral illnesses6;
2. They reported that COVID-19 patients have the lowest count of lymphocytes and the highest neutrophil count and NLR [28]. Wang et al. [29] also showed that several COVID-19 patients have a rising neutrophil count and a falling lymphocyte count during the severe phase [29]

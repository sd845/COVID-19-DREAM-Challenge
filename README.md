# COVID-19-DREAM-Challenge

The rapid rise of COVID-19 has challenged healthcare globally. The underlying risks and outcomes of infection are still incompletely characterized even as the world surpasses 4 million infections. This challenge is hosted by DREAM challenges which are crowdsourcing challenges examining questions in biology and medicine. As the volume and complexity of data continues to increase, it is critical to develop new methods to use data to address fundamental questions to better understand and improve biological sciences and human health. DREAM challenges leverage the wisdom of the crowd to find new and better computational models and then make these methods available to all.

## Definition
Among UW Medicine patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, predict the result of the initial test (positive or negative) using data available at the time the test is performed.

## Input
EHR data from UWMedicine including geographic, demographic, and clinical measures.

## Output
A score between 0 and 1 indicating the likelihood that the patientâ€™s first SARS-CoV-2 test was positive.

## Significance
Only approximately 10% of those meeting current guidelines for testing have a positive result. A successful model may be used to better appropriate scarce testing resources. The features of such a model may provide new insight into the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease.
